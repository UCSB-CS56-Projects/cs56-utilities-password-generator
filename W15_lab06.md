# Project Bugs:
* Entering in special characters does not do anything. It doesn’t add the special character into the password like its supposed to.

# Refactoring of existing code:
* better descriptions of functions
* better descriptions of ant targets (run vs. run 2, for instance) in build.xml
* renaming of password generating methods

# Possible Additional Features to be added:
* Testing. Add JUnit tests for the function in Password.java. There currently are no *Test.java files in /src, so “ant test” successfully builds and returns a positive. 
	* Note: another long-term goal for more complex GUI work would also require unit testing of the GUI, which would most likely be done with the Robot testing framework. But, for the time being, that’s beyond the scope of this project.
* Finer control of password recipe
	* uppercase, min/max
	* lowercase, min/max
	* digits, min/max
* special chars, min/max
* Ability to generate multiple passwords
* Fix the GUI
	* Add minimum/maximum window size (So no clipping of window)
	* Add checkboxes 
	* Reformat layout of text and text boxes for completeness and readability
