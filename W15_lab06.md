## Project Bugs:
* Entering special characters does not actually change the generated password. This functionality needs to be implemented.

## Refactoring of existing code:
* improve descriptions and commenting on code, for accessibility to strangers to the project - **50 points**
* improve descriptions of ant targets (i.e. run vs. run 2) in build.xml - **25 points**
* restructuring and renaming of password generating methods - **50 points**

## Possible Additional Features to be added:
* Testing. 
	* Add JUnit tests for the function in Password.java. There currently are no Test.java files in /src, so ```ant test``` successfully builds, tests nothing, and returns a positive result **100 points**
	* Note: another long-term goal for more complex GUI work would also require unit testing of the GUI, which would most likely be done with the Robot testing framework. But, for the time being, thatâ€™s beyond the scope of this project.
* NEW features
	* user prompts upon click of "generate" - **50 points**
		* remind user to enter values if fields are left blank
		* prompt user to enter *valid* values into fields (currently, if chars are entered into min/max fields, password simply doesn't generate)

	* better control of password recipe - **150 points**
		* uppercase, min/max
		* lowercase, min/max
		* digits, min/max
		* special chars, min/max, default set or user's set

	* JUnit testing for new back-end functions - **100 points**
		
* Ability to generate multiple passwords - **50 points**

* Fix the current GUI - **100 points**
	* Reformat layout of text and text boxes (2-column format of "prompt: [entry in text box]" is more appropriate)
	* Add minimum/maximum window size (So no clipping of content occurs if window is resized)

* NEW GUI - **100 points**
	* Add checkboxes allowing selection of uppercase, digits, etc.
	* if the user enters numbers into the min/max fields, check-box should automatically activate (and perhaps the opposite should happen, if the user leaves a blank output)
	* WIP - ADD A PHOTO OF THE NEW GUI HERE
