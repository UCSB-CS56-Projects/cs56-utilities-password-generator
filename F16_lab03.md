* a) This project is a random password generator. It allows you to specify 
the length of the password and to some extent which characters are used.
* b) As a user I can generate random passwords so that my passwords are 
more secure.
As a user I can generate passwords containing upper case letters, lower case letters,
digits, and symbols or any combination of those four fields so that I can 
meet password restrictions.
As a user I can generate a random password of a specified length so that I can
meet password restrictions.
* c) The software does run and generates one seemingly random password but
cannot generate more than one password. It breaks characters into 4 categories
that can be specified to appear or not appear in the password but does not 
have a field where one can put illegal characters. It cannot store the 
passwords or write them to a file.
* d) As a user I would like to be able to store my passwords securely so that 
I do not have to remember them myself.
As a user I would like to be able to define illegal characters so that I can
conform to the password rules of individual websites and programs.
As a user I would like to be able to create passwords that incorporate human 
language so that I can remember them easier.
