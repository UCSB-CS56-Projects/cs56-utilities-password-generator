* a) This project is a random password generator. It allows you to specify 
the length of the password and to some extent which characters are used.<br /><br />
* b) As a user I can generate random passwords so that my passwords are 
more secure.<br /><br />
As a user I can generate passwords containing upper case letters, lower case letters,
digits, and symbols or any combination of those four fields so that I can 
meet password restrictions.<br /><br />
As a user I can generate a random password of a specified length so that I can
meet password restrictions.<br /><br />
* c) The software does run and generates one seemingly random password but
cannot generate more than one password. It breaks characters into 4 categories
that can be specified to appear or not appear in the password but does not 
have a field where one can put illegal characters. It cannot store the 
passwords or write them to a file.<br /><br />
* d) As a user I would like to be able to store my passwords securely so that 
I do not have to remember them myself.<br /><br />
As a user I would like to be able to define illegal characters so that I can
conform to the password rules of individual websites and programs.<br /><br />
As a user I would like to be able to create passwords that incorporate human 
language so that I can remember them easier.<br /><br />
* e) The quality of the current README.md is both good and bad. The information presented is accurate and encompassing, but there is a large amount of text overflow that causes you to need to scroll sideways. No information needs to be added currently, however that may change as we develop the project further.<br /><br />
* f) The build.xml file looks fine. The targets do have descriptions. It works very well for compiling, running, testing, and cleaning the program, but the javadoc command needs updating and some work.<br /><br />
* g) There are currently not enough issues for us to earn 1000 points. Only 850 points worth of issues exist. The issues are clear in terms of what the expectations are.<br /><br />
* h) Psuedo-random<br />
Larger range of options for a password<br />
Secure storage<br /><br />
* i) There are 5 different .java files that contain five different classes. All of the code is very well tabulated, except for the code in the GUI class, which is not as clear than the others. They all had class descriptions except for CharType.java. All of the class descriptions should be updated with a little more detailed information. Most of the methods had comments, but they need to be more friendly towards people who are not familiar with the code. This is especially true for the test class which has comments for each test, but doesn't have enough information on exactly what is being tested. Almost all of the instance variables were lacking comments.<br /><br />
The purpose of the classes are all clear, save CharType.java which does not have a class description. As mentioned above they need to become a little more user friendly. The purpose of the methods are fairly clear. Several methods have no comments at all, and almost all of them need more information, so that someone can gain insight on it without having to look at the code. It is obvious how the classes relate to each other. The classes are well seperated and have good object oriented relationships with each other.<br /><br />
The code is easy to read because it is well tabulated, but because the comments are often vague it is hard to understand right away. To get someone up to speed quickly we would begin by giving them a description of what the program actually does and its features, as well as any major issues and where the faults may lie. Next we would supply the class descriptions as well as the names of the important methods and what they do.<br /><br />
* j) There are 9 JUnit tests that are fairly long. These tests seem to cover all aspects of the project in its current state, except for the GUI, including varying amounts of character types and password length. It tests the constructors of all the classes and their methods. <br/><br />
To expand test coverage, we will create more tests to check our fixes of the current issues and any new content we create. This may involve changing or getting rid of the current tests. We would also supply more detailed comments for any future or existing tests to make it clearer what each one is looking for or doing.
